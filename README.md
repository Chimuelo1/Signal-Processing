# Signal-Processing
CSC Scientific Computing Assignment focusing on Signal processing.
Implemented the Fast Fourier algorithm to work with signals. Implemented filters for both 1D (Audio) Signals and 2D (Images) Signals, as well as implemented correlation and convolution to interpret Radar data and compare images. Also decoded DTMF tones.
